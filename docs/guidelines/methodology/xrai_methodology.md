# XRAI Methodology
The aim of this section is to provide a technical reference to integrate XRAI methods into data science (DS) projects, so that each DS team can make design choices, and take practical steps to enable explainability to other developers and stakeholders.

As we have described the XRAI Principles, we now move forward to utilizing a Methodology that exemplifies using these principles throughout the three intervention stages of 1) Input, 2) Model and Output (M&O), and 3) Deployment and Monitoring (D&M). Note that theoretical assumptions that adjustments made to input data, model training, and other aspects of the ML process will decrease the accuracy or performance of the models, remain unfounded [(Rodolfa et al., 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00396-x).
