# XRAIDashboard.fairness.fairness_algorithm.reject_option
**[XRAIDashboard.fairness.fairness_algorithm.reject_option(model, train_data, test_data, target_feature, protected, privileged_classes, favorable_classes=[1.0])](https://github.com/gaberamolete/XRAIDashboard/blob/main/fairness/fairness_algorithm.py)**


Executes use of AI Fairness 360's Meta Classifier algorithm. The meta algorithm here takes the fairness metric as part of the input and returns a classifier optimized w.r.t. that fairness metric.


**Parameters:**
-  model: the classifier model object
- train_data (pd.DataFrame): the train split from the dataset, must be preprocessed beforehand
- test_data (pd.DataFrame): the test split from the dataset, must be preprocessed beforehand
- target_feature (str): the target feature
- protected (list): list of protected features
- privileged_classes (list(list)): a 2d list containing the privileged classes for each protected feature
- favorable_classes (list): a list of favorable classes in the target feature, restricted to n-1 length, where n is the number of classes

**Returns:**
None
