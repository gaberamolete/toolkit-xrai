{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The Toolkit provides a one-stop tool for technical tests were identified by packaging widely used open-source libraries into a single platform, according to ADI/DSAI user needs. These tools include python libraries such as `dice-ml`, `alibi`, `interpret-community`, `dalex`, `scikit-learn`, and UI visualization libraries such as `raiwidgets` and `explainerdashboard`. This toolkit aims to: 
- Provide a user interface to guide users step-by-step in the testing process; 
- Support certain binary classification and regression models that use tabular data;
- Produce a basic summary report to help DSAI System Developers and Owners interpret test results;
- Intended to be deployable in the userâ€™s environment.
