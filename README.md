# Explainable and Responsible AI Toolkit
***Developed by AI&I COE***

The **DSAI Explainable and Responsible AI (XRAI) Toolkit** is a complementary tool to the [XRAI Guidelines document](https://unionbankphilippines.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/DataScienceInsightsTeam/EbGWZEJkn7REt1zzHspu-xABsLDpD1eD6mgHMjPJypnzdA?e=wm55U7). The Toolkit provides a one-stop tool for technical tests were identified by packaging widely used open-source libraries into a single platform, according to ADI/DSAI user needs. These tools include Python libraries such as `shap`, `dalex`, `dice-ml`, `alibi`, `netcal`, `aif360`, `scikit-learn`, and UI visualization libraries such as `raiwidgets` and `plotly`. This toolkit aims to: 
- Provide a user interface to guide users step-by-step in the testing process; 
- Support certain binary classification and regression models that use tabular data 
- Produce a basic summary report to help DSAI System Developers and Owners interpret test results 
- Intended to be deployable in the userâ€™s environment

Subsequent versions and updates will be found in the XRAI [GitHub repo](https://github.com/aboitiz-data-innovation/XRAI), accompanied by XRAI Brownbag sessions.
